# CheerUps!

##Technologies used: html, css, ruby, ActiveRecord

##My Approach
- Created a database with tables for users, CheerUps, Tags, and a final table to link CheerUps and Tags in a many to many relationship.
- Set up basic login, logout, and register options for users
- Built pages to create new CheerUps and display CheerUps, including validations for creating new CheerUps that fit standards
- Added a Like table and linked it to CheerUps and users
- Allow users to edit and add tags to the CheerUps they made
- Validations requiring login to create and like CheerUps
- Search option to filter by tags, in addition to clicking on tags to see their unique feeds

##Instructions: CheerUps can be used passively or actively
- Login or become a member so your activity is tracked and you can engage in all capabilities
- Browse randomly suffled CheerUps on your homepage feed, or search by tag that fits your mood to get inspired.
- Create CheerUps to add to the community.  You can either write your own message or quote, or you can upload an image or meme.
- Like CheerUps that resonante with you to show your support and save them to your My Liked CheerUp pages.
- Enjoy!

##Unsolved problems
- Display error message invalid login info
- Option for any user to add tags to other users' CheerUps
- User ranking system
